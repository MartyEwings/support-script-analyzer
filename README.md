# support-script-analyzer

A set of scripts to extract information from archives generated by the enterprise support script.  The output of each job is in json.

## Requirements
* `jq`
* GNU `awk`
* `bash` 4+
* GNU `coreutils`

## Usage
```support_parse.sh <job> <support_archive.tar.gz>```

Currently implemented jobs are
* db_sizes
* modules
* tech_check

json output can be converted to HTML with some basic styling by saving to a file and passing the filename as an argument to `convert.py`.  The required Python libraries can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
